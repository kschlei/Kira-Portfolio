                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    I started this organization in May 2021 with the goal of tutoring new-coming students from South Korea in all things STEM. 
                    As someone who moved to Canada at 5 years old, I knew how difficult the transition of moving countries was, especially with a language barrier (and this was just kindergarten!)
                    After seeing so many young Korean students struggling within academics, knowing how intelligent and capable they actually were, I decided to take initiative. 
                    I wanted to make a space where students would not just get help with STEM subjects, but also have somewhere and someone who would understand to go to when things inevitably got difficult.
                    <br> <br> So, KS Tutoring started just 3 months after beginning the effort, with just myself and 5 students. Each day of the week I would meet with one student for an hour, helping with whatever subjects they needed, often incorperating half-hour english lessons, and sometimes just talking about their days. 
                    Seeing these students grow within the next year as both students and people was incredible and inspiring. Because of this I wanted to expand my outreach, so I brought in more tutors and more students as time went on. Now, KS Tutoring has 5 tutors and 20 students learning and growing with us! 
                    <br> <br>This has been my passion project since I was 16, so thank you for taking the time to learn about us! I hope you enjoyed my long spiel about it :)
