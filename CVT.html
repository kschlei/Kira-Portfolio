                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a project I recently did at Baja SAE. In the 2024 season, the stock CVT faced a lot of issues, mainly with traction/torque (struggles in hill climb) and overheating.
                    To address this issue, I dove into the research and analysis of exactly what parts of the CVT were causing the traction issues. 
                    At last after weeks of reading paper after paper and creating traction curve after traction curve, the team looked at the research and determined the culprits were both the primary and secondary spring, as well as the flyweights.
                    So, the flyweights and springs got swapped out and replaced with ones with the appropriate properties.

            <h2> Calculations and Analysis </h2> <br>

        <p> <b>Primary Clutch: </b><br>
            Tuning the CVT to engage at an RPM that matches the engine's torque peak would allow for efficient power transfer and vehicle responsiveness. 
            According to the following engine torque curve for the CX9, this was observed to be 2800 RPM. 
        </p>

            </div>
        <p>
            Using this information, the RPM at which the clutch engages was measured with a tachometer at approximately 3000 RPM. 
            This provided insight into the initial dynamics of power transfer between the engine and the drivetrain, and it was observed that the engagement RPM was slightly higher than the observed recommended average of 2800 RPM. 
            This showed that there were issues with the CVT’s torque transfer and power and therefore demonstrated why hill-climbing was the 2024 vehicle’s primary weakness.

        <p>
            Lighter flyweights would delay the CVT’s shift into a higher gear, allowing for increased engagement RPMs. This would result in better acceleration and improved top-end speed, making it a preferred configuration for flat terrain and high-speed applications. 
            Conversely, heavier flyweights would promote earlier engagement enhancing low-end torque for hill climbs and rugged terrain, addressing the late clutch engagement at 3650 RPM that was observed in the baseline data collection. 
            <br> To determine a reasonable flyweight to use to begin testing, the equation above was used,
            where r is the radius at which the flyweights rotate about the pivot point, measured at 0.05 m, 
            and ⍵ is the angular velocity of the engine in rad/s, previously calculated for stored data at 376.99 rad/s. 
            Table 1 was created using testing data to detemine a good starting weight of 18g (stock weight is 15g) to begin the tuning process.

            The following equation was used during testing of the new flyweight to keep track of the new engine speeds where the flyweight engages.

        <p> 
            Primary spring stiffness was another critical factor in CVT modifications. 
            A stiffer spring would help maintain the engine within its power band by increasing the engagement RPM and would therefore provide increased power at lower RPMs. 
            A softer spring was recommended to be avoided, as implementing a softer primary spring would result in power loss at lower speeds. 
            Instead, with a stock spring of 200 lbs, a marginally stiffer spring of around 220 lbs was found to be the most suitable for keeping in mind the late engagement issues of the CVT, while also balancing this modification with the new flyweights, as only adjusting the flyweight mass could cause the CVT to engage too early and pull out of its power band when accelerating
            <br> <br> As shown in the following equations, Hooke’s law was taken into consideration for initial spring conditions, and an adjusted pre-load to assist in selecting appropriate springs, ensuring forces were kept reasonable while also keeping the shift point at around 3600 RPM as was determined a reasonable engagement RPM within the baseline data collection.

        <p> <b>Secondary Clutch: </b><br>
            The torsional spring preload would impact belt tension and torque transfer, increasing the preload would enhance clamping force, minimizing the risk of belt slippage. 
            However, this would also raise heat generation due to the increased friction between the sheaves and the belt. 
            Heat generation was a large issue in the 2024 competition, as the CVT was often overheating due to the lack of a heat management system. 
            This issue was addressed separately by adding a ventilation system to the CVT casing, allowing torsional spring adjustments. <br> <br>
            The testing for this is still in progress, so for the second clutch, the starting point for modifications was decided to be increasing the torsional spring stiffness by 10-20% to assist with torque transfer. 
            This would later be followed by performance testing on incline to ensure optimal performance without introducing excessive wear. 
            Due to the high impact the torsional spring has on the belt, its tension was closely monitored during these adjustments and should continue to be during testing. 
            Insufficient tension could lead to belt slippage, while excessive tension accelerates wear and reduces efficiency.
